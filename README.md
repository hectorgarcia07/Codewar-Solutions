# :trophy: Daily Coding Challenge

This repository is just where I collect my daily coding challenge solutions.

## :thinking: Why?

I do daily challenges for a few reasons:
* I love a good puzzle to get my creative juices flowing
* Daily practice = Repetition of core concepts
* Love competing against my clan members. 
* It's just fun!

## :notebook: My Process

After I finish doing my daily challenges for the day, I put each codewars kata into a seperate JavaScript file along with the kata name, url, instructions, examples and finally the code itself. I then upload them to GitHub with each challenge going into its respective kyu folder.

These challenges are a study tool for me, so you'll likely see multiple solutions in some files. I do this so that I can practice solving the problem in different ways, refactor using something more efficient that I have recently learnt or sometimes just for kicks.
